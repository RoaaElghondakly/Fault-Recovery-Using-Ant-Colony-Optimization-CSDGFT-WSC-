# Fault-Recovery-Using-Ant-Colony-Optimization-CSDGFT-WSC-
The CSDGFT-WSC framework consists of two main modules: Web Service Composition Validation and Faulty Composition Recovery. It accepts (Service Dependency Graphs) SDGs as input, as well as a web service composition for validation. It examines the input web service composition to determine whether it is faulty or not with respect to the given SDG. For faulty compositions, a search-based algorithm (Modified Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm the Service Dependency Graph-based Ant Colony Optimization (SDG-ACO) ) is applied to generate the optimum composition to replace the faulty one.

The CSDGFT-WSC is developed using C# on visual studio and SQL server. The experimentation was carried out on an Intel(R) Core (TM) i-8550U, 2GHz processor and 16GB RAM. The experiments were conducted multiple times on multiple datasets to ensure efficiency and accuracy of the results.

-The web service composition for validation format is : "Service name,Service name,Service name" .
