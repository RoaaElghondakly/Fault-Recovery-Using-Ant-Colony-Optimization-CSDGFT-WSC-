# Fault-Recovery-Using-Ant-Colony-Optimization-CSDGFT-WSC-
The CSDGFT-WSC framework consists of two main modules: Web Service Composition Validation and Faulty Composition Recovery. It accepts (Service Dependency Graphs) SDGs as input, as well as a web service composition for validation. It examines the input web service composition to determine whether it is faulty or not with respect to the given SDG. For faulty compositions, a search-based algorithm (Modified Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm the Service Dependency Graph-based Ant Colony Optimization (SDG-ACO) ) is applied to generate the optimum composition to replace the faulty one.

-The SDGs datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/roaaaelghondakly/services-dependency-graphs#

-web service composition for validation format is : "Service name,Service name,Service name" .
